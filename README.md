# Top Down Operator Precedence

Playing around with top-down operator precedence parsing.

Thanks to the [oil shell blog][oil] for their write-up, as well as to those who
contributed to keeping the original [paper][] online. 

And [this][java] example in java, which gave me some ideas for how to make this
work better with types. Its funny that it's easier to pull the OOP out of Java
than JavaScript for this.
